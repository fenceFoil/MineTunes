Environment.EXP_BYTE=MCDitty expected a byte (a number from 0-127) somewhere, but encountered the value %s which is not a byte.
Environment.EXP_DOUBLE=MCDitty expected a number somewhere, but encountered the value %s which is not a 'double' (a type of number where a decimal point is allowed).
Environment.EXP_INT=MCDitty expected an number somewhere, but encountered the value %s which is not an integer or is too extremely high/low.
Environment.EXP_LONG=MCDitty expected a number somewhere, but encountered the value %s which is not an Integer or is too extremely high/low.
Environment.NO_DEF=The constant %s (%s) has no definition.  Define this constant before using it.

ParserError.CHAR_NOT_START='%s' is not the start of an %s
ParserError.CHAR_UNEXPECTED=The character '%s' was unexpected while parsing %s
ParserError.INVERSION_EXC=The root given for a chord inversion is less than the initial chord root, or greater than the range of the chord.
ParserError.NOT_READY=The reader is not ready for some reason
ParserError.NOTE_EXC=Note %s is not a valid drum sound name, or is not in the range 0 - 127.
ParserError.NOTE_OCTAVE_EXC=A note is slightly too high or too low to play: The note value %s, calculated by computing (octave*12)+noteValue, is not in the range 0 - 127.
ParserError.NOTE_VELOCITY_EXC=The velocity character in %s is unknown.
ParserError.OCTAVE_EXC=Octave %s is not a number, or is not in the range 0 - 10.
ParserError.PARSER_SPACES_EXC=The token %s sent to Parser.parse() contains spaces.  A token is one unit of musical data, and should not contain a space.

Reset:

A reset is like letting a ditty end, and then starting a new one again. Reset:

- Lets all the music before the keyword play out
- Resets all instruments, the tempo, and the current voice and layer
- Restores the key to C major
- Sets all volumes back to 100
- Turns off effects like Octaves, Staccato, and Tran

Before playing anything after the keyword.

Resets are handy for "breaking up" long or complex songs: they're like the ends of tracks, and starting from one is like starting at the beginning of a song.

Resets do not:

- Remove any JFugue constants set with the $ token
- Change any X token settings
- Reset lyrics

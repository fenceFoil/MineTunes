Updating Minetunes:

*** FROM OLD MC VERSION ***

- Download new MCP
- Use normal MC launcher to download new bin folder
	- Alternately, MultiMC if we're still in snapshot-mode
- Extract MCP
- Update names?
- Put jars in, decompile
- Make copy, put in zip as mcpXXXXX-Clean.7z
- Rename folder mcpXXX-Minetunes

- Copy all .gitignore files and the .git folder to new mcp
- Copy from old mcp's /src/ dir:
	- BlockSign.java
	- and all other minetunes dirs
- Copy over the /lib/ dir

- Open the copied repo in SmartGit Hg

- In MinetunesConfig.java:
	- Update the current version
	- Update the current MC version if new version is not compatible with the previous version's mods
- In BookWrapper.java:
	- Ensure that book length checking is modern (compare with GuiScreenBook.java)
- Resolve any compile errors

- Diff the following clean base source files from the last MC version with the new one's
	- BlockSign
	- BlockNote
	- EntityItemStack (name right?)
	- Packet...Updatesign
	- Packet...LevelSound
	- GuiEditSign
	- GuiScreen
	- GuiScreenBook (note book saving to server esp.)
	- TileEntitySign
	- TileEntitySignRenderer
	- Block
- If any changes are found, deal with them in all affected Minetunes Classes
- Watch esp. for overridden classes' method names: there's no @Override annotation in decompiled code!!! Ensure that methods are still being overriden.

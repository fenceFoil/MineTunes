Staccato [0-8] [length]

Plays all notes in the current voice staccato: shorter, with pauses between

[0-8]: Optional. Higher means less staccato. 4 is default.
[length]: Optional. How long to apply staccato effect. 

Following a no-length 'staccato' with a length 'staccato' will apply the length 'staccato's effect, then go back to the no-length one. This way, you can set a staccato up for a whole song, but still be able to add a different staccato for short segments.

Example:

Staccato wh

Applies a staccato effect for a whole + a half note.

PlayMIDI
[Next Line Contains The Filename]

Plays a MIDI file from /.minecraft/mineTunes/midi/

The filename should be letters and numbers, with no symbols or spaces. ".mid" or ".midi" is automatically added to the end.

There is no guarantee that the MIDI will be played in sync with the SignTune. There will be a pause before the MIDI begins playing.

SING

Lyrics played after this point will be "sung" by a voice synthesizer.

To change the pitch of the synthesizer or its speed, put control tokens in the lyrics to sing:

~G3 changes the pitch to G3
~Db4 changes the pitch to Db4
~100 changes the rate to 100 words per minute.
~200 changes the rate to 200 words per minute.

The voice's normal pitch is G3: a low bass voice. Default words per minute is 150. 

You can only include these control tokens once per lyric, and they don't appear when the lyric is printed on the chat.

BUG: If a lyric is set to be sung AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT of a SignTune, it will be silent. Solution: Add a single "R" token to the end of the signtune to move the last moment until after the lyric.

[SFX]: A SFX name. The first '#' is what MC version sounds to use: options are 1 and 2. Second '#' is which variant of the SFX to play.

[Tuning] (Optional): A note (As in B2). At this pitch, the SFX is sounds normal. Some SFX have a default tuning.

Note that if there are multiple sounds for a given SFX (ex: different cat meows), you can specify one in particualar by saying, for example, "meow1" or "meow2", etc.

Note that this keyword tries to activate one 32nd beat BEFORE its location in the ditty to let the SFXInst load.

This keyword may not be immediate: there might be a short pause before the SFX Instrument replaces the normal instrument sound.

SFX instruments are guaranteed to sound precicely the same on every computer, while normal MIDI intruments vary in sound or volume.

Area [width] [depth] [optional height]

Area creates an invisible field in front of this sign. If someone enters the field, they activate this sign.

The area's height and width are centered on the sign; depth goes straight out from the sign.

Areas on diagonal sign posts currently don't go diagonally.

Area songs automatically have §bOneAtATime§r added. Therefore to make an area that only activates once, add a long rest such as "Repeat 100 / Rw" to the end of the ditty.
